#Interactive Development in Processing 2 IAD-1-ID2PROC-14

Are you an artist or designer interested in understanding how to create work that generates from simple rules? Are you curious about complexity, biological patterns or natural phenomena as a material for your creative experiments? In this course, we will use programming to understanding reoccurring forms that often materialise in the world around us. Topics covered will include: drawing techniques, noise, basic physics, trigonometry, particle systems and artificial intelligence. Expect to be exposed to new ideas that may take you a lifetime to fully integrate into your process. Course Objective: Participants will understand and experiment with natural phenomena as material for creative works. Students will produce a series of small experiments throughout class that deepen creative thinking. This course will be fast paced and offer material that can be explored over a number of years. 

Expectations: 

There will be 2 assignments due during this class, each worth half 50% of the final grade. One assignment you define yourselves and one is given to the class. 

The assignment defined by you will be due the final day of the class. 

The assignment given to each member of the class
Students will evolve an ecology and  are expected to present changes and developments to this code weekly. The goal? Create anecology and infuse it with life. Build a world and make it as alive as possible. Students are graded based on how much of each week's chapter they integrate into the project.

Week One: Eclipse 
So remember your first bike? The kind that you pushed but had no peddles? It let you get your balance but there was no real speed to be had in it. This is the processing IDE. In this class we will be using processing as grown ups within the Eclipse IDE. That said, if you are unable to get Eclipse installed, or it's too scary, you can remain in the processing IDE. However, I'd suggest moving on at this point. 
Topics: Basics of the Eclipse environment and using processing in Eclipse

Week Two: Github 

We make mistakes. In fact, wouldn't you like an undo button for your code? Well guess what, such a magical time machine does exist and it is called github. All of your homework going forward from this class onward should be uploaded to github by the day of the class. No late assignments are excepted. 

Topics: Basic unix commands, the creation of a code repository and a fundamental understanding of source control.
